## Anagrams

Code looks good. Your output is just the items in the dictionary, which is 1) impossible to read 2) inlcudes many items that have only a
single entry and can't really be considered "anagrams".

## Word Ladders

Excellent! Really clean and concise implementation.

## Boggle

Looks good. The choice to use iterative-deepening is interesting: it makes things a little trickier. It does recover all previous words
on each search, which you're dealing with correctly.

Good work!
